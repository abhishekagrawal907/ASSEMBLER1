						   JAC ASSEMBLER :


JAC ASSEMBLER IS A HYPOTHETICAL COMPUTING MACHINE WHICH COMPILES ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE CODE AND
FORMS AN OBJECT CODE FILE.
THIS MACHINE IS CREATED USING C LANGUAGE WHICH GIVES A CLEAR PICTURE THAT HOW AN ASSEMBLER
ASSEMBLES THE CODE AND PROCESSES EACH COMMAND LINE BY LINE ACCORDINGLY.
THE MAIN MOTIVE OF CREATING THIS MACHINE IS NOT RUN THE PROGRAMME INSTEAD ITS TO DEMONSTRATE THE WORKING OF AN
ASSEMBLER.
